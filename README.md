# Weird onClick behavior

After running the app, click on the phrase at your top right. You will see that another phrase is added.
Now, if you click on this new phrase added, it does not fires onClick function!

## Building

`npm install` and then `npm run build` to build the dist/bundle.js.

# React version

Notice that this only happens if react version 0.13 is used. If 0.14 is used, everything works normally!
